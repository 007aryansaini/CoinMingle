## üñºÔ∏è Inspiration

Introducing **CoinMingle**, a groundbreaking project that draws inspiration from the revolutionary decentralized exchange, Uniswap. **CoinMingle** embraces the core principles of Uniswap and builds upon its success to bring a new level of innovation to the **decentralized exchange** space. It adopts an **automated market maker (AMM)** model, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets.

Similar to Uniswap's emphasis on liquidity provision, CoinMingle encourages users to contribute to the platform's liquidity pools. By doing so, users can earn rewards in the form of transaction fees and native tokens. This incentivize participants to actively engage with the platform and contributes to the overall liquidity and stability of the **CoinMingle** ecosystem.

## üèÜ The proud moment

We are incredibly proud of the accomplishments we have achieved in building our DeFi app **CoinMingle**.

- **Successful Deployment**: We successfully deployed our DeFi app on the Fantom blockchain, allowing users to seamlessly trade tokens and participate in liquidity provision and also deploy your own ERC20 tokens.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: We designed a user interface that prioritizes a seamless and intuitive user experience. Our interface enables users to easily navigate through the app, perform token swaps, add or remove liquidity, and access important information.

- **Efficient Token Swapping**: We enables fast and efficient token swapping using advanced algorithms and liquidity pools. Users can instantly execute trades at competitive prices, providing a smooth trading experience with minimal slippage.

- **Liquidity Provision Features**: We developed robust liquidity provision features, allowing users to add or remove liquidity to pools with ease. Our system ensures accurate pool calculations, transparent fee distribution, and incentivizes liquidity providers with rewards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we build **CoinMingle**

- In the process of creating **CoinMingle**, **DeFi**, short for decentralized finance, is a revolutionary concept that aims to transform traditional financial systems by providing open, permissionless, and trustless financial services. it allows users to trade tokens, liquidity provision & withdrawal, and create ERC20 token.

- Moreover, Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and static websites.

- Additionally, CoinMingle integrates WalletConnect, enables users to connect their wallets to CoinMingle seamlessly, allowing them to securely sign transactions and interact with the platform.

- In terms of infrastructure, CoinMingle utilizes MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database. MongoDB offers scalability, flexibility, and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for managing and storing all liquidity tokens and users positions in this project.

- Overall, CoinMingle provides a comprehensive experience for users interested in engaging with DeFi through a Uniswap-inspired platform. Its utilization of technologies such as Next.js, WalletConnect, and MongoDB showcases the project's commitment to delivering a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for decentralized financial activities.

## üî¨ Challenges we faced

- First of all we wanted to build **DeFi** dApp. The first problem we faced is

</br>

## üîñ Our learnings

- **Token Standards**: First of all we understand the token standard ERC-20 (fungible tokens) is crucial for implementing token functionality within **CoinMingle** app.

- **Token Swapping Mechanics**: Uniswap introduced the concept of automated token swaps through liquidity pools. We gained a deep understanding of how token swaps work, including the constant product formula **p\*q=K**, price impact calculations, slippage tolerance, and the mechanics of decentralized exchanges.

- **Next.js Development**: Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications. By using Next.js, we learned how to structure your DeFi app, handle routing, manage server-side rendering, and leverage Next.js features like API routes for interacting with the Fantom blockchain.

- **Authentication**: With WalletConnect, we gained an understanding of how to authenticate users and authorize their actions within **CoinMingle** app. This involves verifying signatures, and ensuring the security of user interactions with the blockchain.

- **MongoDB Integration**: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers flexibility and scalability. By integrating MongoDB into **CoinMingle**, we learned how to work with document-based data, design database schemas, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and implement data models like list of tokens, liquidity as per wallet address and all available market pairs.

## ‚ùì What's next

We are opening it up as an open-source initiative. We strongly believe in the power of collaboration, community-driven development, and fostering innovation through open-source projects. By making **CoinMingle** app open source, we aim to provide a platform where developers, enthusiasts, and contributors can come together to collectively enhance and shape the future of decentralized finance.

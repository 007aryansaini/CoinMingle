# **CoinMingle**

**CoinMingle** - the ultimate decentralized platform powered by the **FANTOM** blockchain and a sleek **Next.js** frontend. With its cutting-edge **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** smart contract, **CoinMingle** empowers users to effortlessly create their own **ERC20 tokens**, seamlessly **swap tokens**, **boost liquidity**, and **withdraw liquidity**. Get ready to dive into the exciting world of decentralized finance with **CoinMingle** - where innovation meets simplicity! 🌍

This **AMM** uses **`P * Q = K`**, where:

- **`P`** is the amount of one token in the liquidity pool.
- **`Q`** is the amount of the other in the liquidity pool.
- **`K`** is a fixed constant which means the pool’s total liquidity always has to remain the same.

## **🎯 Features**

The AMM smart contract and Next.js frontend provide the following functionalities:

- **Creating ERC20 Tokens**: The frontend also provides functionality for users to create their own ERC20 tokens on the **FANTOM** network. This feature can be valuable for launching new projects or enhancing liquidity by introducing new tokens.

- **Token Swapping**: Users can easily exchange one token for another directly through the smart contract. The swap feature calculates the conversion rate based on the available liquidity in the AMM pool.

- **Liquidity Provision**: Users can add liquidity to the AMM pool by depositing an equal value of both tokens. This action enhances the liquidity and depth of the pool, resulting in efficient token swaps for all users.

- **Liquidity Withdrawal**: Users who have contributed liquidity to the AMM pool can withdraw their fair share of liquidity at any time. The withdrawal process considers the user's proportional ownership in the pool, ensuring an equitable distribution of the tokens.
